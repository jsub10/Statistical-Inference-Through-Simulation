    "In the *From_Probability_to_Statistical_Inference* notebook we learned about the classical statistics recipe for accepting or rejecting a hypothesis. For example, we assumed a coin had a bias of, say, 0.3 towards heads (the hypothesis), and calculated the p-value of the hypothesis based on evidence that consisted of the number of heads observed when the coin was tossed a certain number of times. We also looked at how we could actually get what we needed -- the probability of the *hypothesis* given the evidence. Recall that with the classical p-value recipe, we just skirted this calculation and instead kept calculating the probability of the *evidence* given the hypothesis and then tried to make the most of it. Bayes rule gives us the first probability and it's the one we really need.\n",

In this notebook we'll cover these concepts.\n",
